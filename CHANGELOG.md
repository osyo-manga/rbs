## 2.2.0 (2022-02-22)

RBS 2.2 ships with a new syntax to specify the visibility of a method per definition bases.

```rbs
class Foo
  private def hello: () -> void

  private attr_accessor world: String
end
```

It also changes the semantics of `self?` method.
It defines both _public_ singleton method and _private_ instance method, which is equivalent to `module_function`.

## Signature updates

* Let `self?.` be equivalent to `module_function` ([\#910](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/910))

### Library changes

### Signature updates

* Documents imported from Ruby 3.1 ([\#881](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/881))
* Methods/classes updated in Ruby 3.1 ([\#886](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/886))

## 2.0.0 (2021-12-24)

### Bounded Generics

RBS 2.0 ships with _bounded generics_, which improves the expressiveness of the language by adding a new syntax to define constraints on type parameters.

```rbs
class PrettyPrint[T < _Output]
  interface _Output
    def <<: (String) -> void
  end

  attr_reader output: T

  def initialize: (T output) -> void
end
```

This is the motivating example I found in the [prettyprint library](https://github.com/ruby/prettyprint).
The `#initialize` receives a object of type `T` and it must have `#<<` method.
This is defined with `< _Output` syntax in the example.
It means _`T` has to be compatible with `_Output` interface._
`PrettyPrint[String]` is okay, but `PrettyPrint[Integer]` is a type error.

See [the PR for details](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/844).

### RBS Collection manager

RBS Collection feature is generally available on RBS 2.0. In short, it is Bundler for RBS. You can manage RBSs of standard libraries and third party gems with `rbs collection` subcommand.

```bash
$ rbs collection init
created: rbs_collection.yaml

# The `install` command set up RBS files and creates `rbs_collection.lock.yaml` file
$ rbs collection install
Installing actionpack:6.0 (actionpack@ce6664cec73)
(...snip...)
Using tsort:0 (/path/to/rbs-2.0.0/stdlib/tsort/0)
It's done! 21 gems' RBSs now installed.

# Now you can use `rbs`, `typeprof` and `steep` commands with the dependencies out of the box!
$ rbs validate
$ typeprof app.rb
$ steep check
```

RBS 2.0 also introduces `manifest.yaml` to declare the dependencies from your gems to standard libraries explicitly.
See [the documentation](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/blob/master/docs/collection.md) for more information.

### Breaking changes

This version contains a bug fix, which potentially breaks the compatibility with older versions.
The super class names in class definitions are now resolved in _outer_ context.
It was an incompatibility with Ruby and [this PR](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/856) fixed the problem.

### Signature updates

* uri ([\#846](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/846), [\#852](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/852), [\#851](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/851), [\#850](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/850), [#849](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/849))

### Language updates

* Bounded generics ([\#844](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/844))

### Library changes

* Add `manifest.yaml` for collection to specify stdlib dependencies ([\#808](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/808))
* Remove experimental warning of `rbs collection` ([\#855](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/855))
* Add the utility `#map_type` methods ([\#841](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/841))

## 1.8.1 (2021-12-13)

### Library changes

* Validate `extend` arguments ([\#840](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/840))
* Allow a relative path as git remote in collection ([\#839](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/839))

## 1.8.0 (2021-12-02)

RBS 1.8.0 ships with a language feature enhancement, _generic type alias_.
You can define a type alias with type parameters now.

```rbs
type list[T] = [T, list[T]] | nil  # Defines a list of type T

type int_list = list[Integer]      # List of Integer
type string_list = list[String]    # List of String
```

You can find the detail in the [PR](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/823).

### Signature updates

* `Date#+`, `Date#-` ([\#830](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/830))
* `#include?`, `#member?`, `#delete`, `#count` ([\#835](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/835))

### Miscellaneous

* Use `untyped` as an expectation of return value of `IO#ready?` in test ([\#828](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/828/files))

## 1.7.0 (2021-11-11)

This version replaces `RBS::Parser` implementation from pure Ruby code based on [Racc](https://github.com/ruby/racc) to C extension.
It improves the RBS file parsing performance up to 5 times faster. :rocket:

* There are some incompatibilities to drop obsolete syntax rules: `super` keyword and `any` type are no longer supported.
* [re2c](https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c) is used to generate lexical generator.

When you want to change the parser/lexer, change the files under `ext/rbs_extension` directory and run `rake compile` to compile the extension.

## 1.1.0 (2021-03-08)

### Summary

Errors are now organized by `RBS::BaseError`, `RBS::ParsingError`, `RBS::LoadingError`, and `RBS::DefinitionError`.
The library users can rescue RBS related errors with `RBS::BaseError`, parsing errors with `RBS::ParsingError`, and other errors with `RBS::LoadingError` and `RBS::DefinitionErrors`.

Updating a part of environments are supported. Library users can remove declarations read from a set of files, adding new declarations, running name resolution related to the new decls, and deleting `DefinitionBuilder` caches related to the changes.
See `RBS::Environment#reject`, `RBS::Environment#resolve_type_names`, `RBS::AncestorGraph`, and `RBS::DefinitionBuilder#update`.

`RBS::DefinitionBuilder#build_singleton` now returns definitions containing `instance` type, which had returned resolved class instance types. This is a breaking change, but we consider it a bug fix because `RBS::DefinitionBuilder#build_instance` has returned `instance` types and `#build_singleton` has returned `class` type.
